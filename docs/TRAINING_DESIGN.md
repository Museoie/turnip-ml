# Trick-Detection Training Design (`turnip-ml`)

**Scope.** This document is the training-side detailed design for `turnip-ml`,
implementing §6 of the master plan
(`https://github.com/hoiekim/turnip-farm/blob/main/docs/MASTER_PLAN.md`).
It covers dataset construction, the training task and architecture,
evaluation, the anti-poisoning quarantine loop, promotion, and versioning.
Companion docs: the farm's `BACKEND_DESIGN.md` (tables, export endpoint)
and `POSE_FORMAT.md` (pose wire format). In-flight implementation this design
aligns with: PR #17 (deterministic stratified splitter), PR #18 (champion
training script + CI smoke test), PR #19 (holdout evaluation), PR #20
(champion/challenger promotion gate). Where this document proposes beyond
what those PRs implement, it says so explicitly.

## 1. Data contract: what training consumes

- Only **confirmed** clips + labels. The farm has no draft/pending clip
  lifecycle (master plan §1–§2), so everything reachable via
  `GET /api/labels/export?since=` is training-eligible by construction.
- Privacy posture: pose keypoints (TKP1) + labels only. Never video, never
  personal data (master plan §1).
- The export excludes quarantined sources (master plan §4) and presents
  one **(source, clip, canonical trick name)** row per label — see §2.2.

## 2. Dataset construction

### 2.1 Export and watermarking

- The nightly job pulls `GET /api/labels/export?since=<watermark>`,
  receiving pose-blob R2 references, clip windows, raw label strings,
  `user_id`, and the `taxonomy_version` in effect at label time.
- The watermark is the last successful export timestamp, stored in the
  training workspace (not in the farm). Per master plan §6, the nightly
  run only proceeds when new labels since the watermark exceed 50.

### 2.2 Canonicalization (raw → canonical)

Applied **at dataset build time**, pinned to a single `taxonomy_version`
for the whole training run. The farm preserves raw free-text strings
forever; training consumes canonical names via `label_taxonomy`.

Deterministic pipeline per label string:

1. Normalize: lowercase, trim, collapse internal whitespace.
2. Split combo strings on `-`, `/`, `+`, `,`, and strip parentheticals
   like `(combo)` — e.g. `"hook - scoot - gainer - cartfull (combo)"`
   becomes `[hook, scoot, gainer, cartfull]` on one window.
3. Look up each token in `label_taxonomy` at the pinned
   `taxonomy_version` → canonical name.
4. **Judgment call:** tokens with no mapping keep their normalized form
   as the canonical name and are appended to a curation queue
   (`unmapped_labels.log`) for later taxonomy work. Rationale: failing
   closed on unmapped names would starve early training when the
   vocabulary is still growing; the log feeds the taxonomy curation loop
   (master plan §9, open question 1).

Clip → Label shape (decided): the farm stores **one label row per
`(clip_id, trick_name)`** (`BACKEND_DESIGN.md` §1.1) — one-to-many at
every level (Source → Clip → Label). The export is already
label-granular (§1), so the dataset builder consumes one
`(clip_id, raw trick name)` row per export row and canonicalizes each
through `label_taxonomy` at the pinned `taxonomy_version` (above).

### 2.3 Training targets

- One **segment** per confirmed clip window: `(start_frame, end_frame)`
  in source-frame coordinates (absolute indices into the source's
  canonical 10 Hz pose sequence).
- Multi-label: a combo clip with N canonical names becomes one segment
  with an N-hot target vector over the canonical vocabulary (vocabulary
  size fixed at the pinned `taxonomy_version`).
- `is_combo` is derived (`len(trick_names) > 1`); the combo MVP does not
  sub-segment individual tricks (master plan §6).

### 2.4 Gap handling

- TKP1 gap frames (all-zero confidence) are **missing data**. They break
  interpolation and are never synthesized across (master plan §3).
- Input features per frame: 17×3 `(x, y, confidence)` **plus one binary
  gap-indicator channel** = 52 dims per frame. The indicator lets the
  model distinguish "athlete at origin" from "no observation".
- Loss masking: any frame-level auxiliary loss ignores gap frames.
  Segment-level targets are unaffected — a labeled window may contain
  gaps; the label still applies to the window.
- Sequences are consumed at full source length in the dataset. Windowing,
  if needed for memory, is an architecture/training detail, not a
  dataset one.

### 2.5 Background negatives

- Non-labeled regions of contributed sources serve as background
  negatives (master plan §6).
- **Judgment call:** exclude a ±2 s margin around every labeled window
  from the background pool. Boundaries are where labelers disagree, and
  training on them as hard negatives injects label noise. The margin
  width is a config constant to be tuned empirically.

### 2.6 Splits (aligns with PR #17)

- Stratified by `user_id`, target 80/10/10 train/val/holdout. No user's
  clips leak across splits; all sources of one user land in one split.
- Deterministic: seeded RNG, sorted ids, byte-identical `split.json`
  (PR #17's `split_dataset.py` is the implementation).
- Admin-curated holdout pinning: a pinned sample id pulls its whole user
  into holdout — the poisoning-defense anchor. The holdout set stays
  admin-curated (master plan §6).
- The holdout split is **never loaded for training** — enforced at load
  time by the training script (PR #18), not by convention.
- Bootstrap guard (master plan §6): until the contributor pool exceeds
  ~20 users (or any split would hold fewer than 50 clips), fall back to
  unstratified random splits — user-stratification on a handful of
  contributors yields degenerate splits.
- The dataset manifest (sample ids, split assignment, taxonomy_version,
  export watermark, split seed) is written next to the dataset; a
  training run is reproducible from the manifest alone.

## 3. Task definition

- **Input:** pose key sequence, `T × 52`, canonical 10 Hz TKP1 (features
  per §2.4).
- **Output:** trick segments in **source-frame coordinates** — absolute
  frame indices into the source's canonical 10 Hz sequence — each with
  `trick_names: [...]` (canonical names) and derived `is_combo`.
- This is detection + naming, not pose estimation. Pose quality is gated
  separately by the existing `PoseAccuracy` harness and CI baseline
  (master plan §6, "What stays"); fine-tuning MoveNet is off the table.

## 4. Architecture

### 4.1 In-flight baseline (PR #18)

The current training script implements a **windowed softmax-linear
classifier** over per-joint mean position + mean speed, with an
`init_checkpoint` path that continues from the champion (the fine-tune
path). The CI smoke test trains it on a synthetic fixture. This is the
MVP that proves the pipeline end-to-end; it is not the production
architecture.

### 4.2 Proposed production architecture

- **Temporal encoder** over the keypoint sequence (52-dim with gap
  channel): a **dilated temporal convolutional network (TCN)** is the
  first choice — small footprint, strong local temporal structure, and
  straightforward Core ML conversion. A small Transformer encoder is the
  fallback if long-range context proves decisive; it costs more
  parameters and latency.
- **Segment proposal head:** anchor-free per-frame boundary regression
  (predict start/end offsets per frame) or per-frame BIO tagging with
  boundary refinement. Either emits candidate segments with scores.
- **Per-segment classification head:** multi-label classifier over the
  canonical vocabulary — sigmoid per class, not softmax, because combos
  carry multiple names.
- **Rationale:** tricks are temporal patterns in joint trajectories;
  frame-wise classifiers (the §4.1 baseline) cannot model duration or
  boundaries. The encoder → proposal → classification split mirrors the
  output contract directly (segments + names).
- **On-device constraint (proposal — unmeasured):** the published model
  must run on-device via Core ML. Budget: ≤ 2 M parameters and < 100 ms
  inference for a 60 s (600-frame) sequence on a recent iPhone.
  Architecture choices that break the budget don't ship, regardless of
  validation score.

### 4.3 Post-training conversion

`coremltools` → Core ML (`.mlmodelc`), uploaded to R2; `POST
/api/models` publishes the champion with its manifest (see
`MODEL_CONTRACT.md`). Conversion is a pipeline step, not a manual
action.

## 5. Training loop

Nightly pipeline order:

1. Export new labels since the watermark (`GET /api/labels/export`).
2. Build the dataset (§2): canonicalize at the pinned
   `taxonomy_version`, expand to (clip, name) pairs, attach gap-masked
   TKP1 sequences, sample background negatives.
3. Split deterministically by `user_id` (PR #17).
4. Train the challenger on the train split, initializing from the
   current champion (`init_checkpoint` — the standing fine-tune path;
   from-scratch training is the exception: architecture change or
   taxonomy major bump, decided by the maintainer). Val split for model
   selection; holdout never loaded.
5. Fixture regression gate (§6.3) — challenger vs champion on fixtures.
6. Holdout evaluation (§6.2) — report written next to the artifact.
7. Promotion gate (§8) — champion/challenger on the validation metric.
8. Publish (§9, `MODEL_CONTRACT.md`).

Further loop properties:

- **Cadence:** nightly cron or manual dispatch; skipped when new labels
  since the watermark are ≤ 50 (master plan §6).
- **Determinism:** seeded RNG everywhere, sorted iteration order, no
  timestamps in artifacts — re-runs yield byte-identical `metrics.json`
  (established by PR #18; required of all future training code).
- **Config:** hermetic TOML; unknown/missing keys fail closed (PR #18).
- **Compute:** `compute = "cpu"|"gpu"` remains the single GPU-worker
  seam (PR #18); the nightly job targets the GPU worker when available.
- **Fixture scores** are recorded in the model registry alongside val
  metrics, so the nightly job compares against the champion's fixture
  scores without re-running the champion.

## 6. Evaluation

### 6.1 Metrics (aligns with PR #19)

`Training/evaluate.py` scores a predictions file against the holdout
split and writes a deterministic `holdout_report.json` next to the
artifact:

- **Detection rate** — temporal IoU ≥ 0.5, name-agnostic (did we find
  the trick?).
- **Segment precision / recall / F1** — name match required (did we
  find it *and* name it?).
- **Name accuracy given detection** — of the detected segments, how many
  names are right.
- **Per-name precision/recall** — exposes weak vocabulary entries and
  guides taxonomy curation.
- **Background false-positive count** — spurious segments fired in
  unlabeled regions.

Additionally recommended for the champion/challenger comparison:
**mAP at tIoU ∈ {0.3, 0.5, 0.7}** as the segment-quality summary. The
evaluator (PR #19) computes the core set above; mAP is the proposed
promotion-facing roll-up.

Deliberately **not** PCK: PCK is a pose-estimation metric. Pose
estimation is MoveNet's job and is gated separately by the
`PoseAccuracy` CI baseline (per the PR #19 discussion).

### 6.2 Holdout protocol

- The holdout split is admin-curated and pinned (PR #17). The evaluator
  rejects predictions for non-holdout or unknown samples — fail closed,
  never silently evaluated (PR #19).
- The evaluator is decoupled from training: it scores predictions
  files, so it works with any architecture emitting the output contract,
  including the §4.2 proposal, without duplicating model math.
- The holdout report is written next to the model artifact, uploaded to
  R2, and referenced from the model manifest (`holdout_report_r2_key`).
  It is recorded for every nightly candidate; the promotion decision
  itself is the validation-metric gate (§8).

### 6.3 Fixture regression gate (anti-poisoning)

- **Fixtures:** the existing pose-accuracy fixtures (guarding the
  *input* to the trick model) **plus** a trick-labeled fixture set —
  fixed (pose sequence, labeled segments) pairs covering the core
  vocabulary and known combos. Fixtures are versioned with the repo;
  adding a fixture is a code change, never data-dependent.
- **Gate:** after training a candidate, run it over the fixtures and
  compare segment IoU + name accuracy against the champion's recorded
  fixture scores.
- **Regression policy (judgment call):** regression iff
  `challenger_fixture_score < champion_fixture_score − 0.01` (absolute,
  on the composite fixture score). Any regression beyond that tolerance
  triggers the quarantine flow (§7) and skips promotion. No human
  override exists in the nightly path; the maintainer can re-run with
  an explicit override flag, which is logged.

## 7. Quarantine mechanics (anti-poisoning)

On fixture regression (master plan §6), in order:

1. **Discord alert** via webhook with: the metrics delta (challenger vs
   champion fixture scores), the affected `source_id`s ingested that
   day, and the responsible `user_id`s (attribution from
   `sources.user_id` — the "basic level of identification" for bad
   data).
2. **Quarantine that day's ingested sources:** one `data_quarantine`
   row per source ingested since the last watermark —
   `(source_id, user_id, reason, metrics JSONB snapshot,
   quarantined_at)`. "That day's ingested data" means sources with
   `created_at` after the previous successful watermark.
3. **Training exclusion:** the export excludes sources with an
   unresolved quarantine row (`resolution IS NULL`) or
   `resolution='purged'`; `resolution='released'` rows are re-included.
4. **Skip promotion** for that night's candidate, regardless of its
   validation metrics.
5. **Review workflow:** the maintainer reviews the quarantine queue and
   marks each row **released** (good data — re-included next night) or
   **purged** (bad data — excluded permanently). Repeated purges
   against one user feed the `users.is_blocked` / reputation decision,
   which remains a manual call.
6. The next nightly run retries with the quarantine applied. The loop
   cannot promote poisoned data even when validation metrics look fine,
   because the fixture gate (§6.3) runs **before** the promotion gate.

## 8. Promotion (aligns with PR #20)

- **Champion/challenger:** `Training/promote.py` compares the
  challenger's `metrics.json` against the champion's. Promote iff the
  challenger beats the champion by **≥ 1% relative** improvement on the
  configured validation metric —
  `(challenger − champion) / champion ≥ 0.01` (PR #20).
- **Judgment call:** for the production architecture (§4.2), the
  promotion metric should be the segment-quality composite (segment F1
  / mAP), not raw window accuracy — `val_accuracy` (PR #20's default)
  is the right default for the §4.1 windowed baseline only. The gate's
  `--metric` flag already supports this; the nightly config chooses
  the metric appropriate to the active architecture.
- Exit codes: 0 = promote, 3 = archive, 2 = input error (fail closed).
  Each decision is appended to the model registry (local
  `Training/registry.json`; the farm's `models` table once
  `POST /api/models` exists).
- **Gate order:** fixture regression (§6.3) → holdout evaluation
  (§6.2, recorded) → promotion gate. A candidate that regresses on
  fixtures never reaches champion/challenger comparison.
- **Rollback:** the registry and the farm `models` table retain every
  promoted champion. Rollback publishes a new `models` row that
  re-promotes the previous champion's artifacts — a new unique
  `version` (`trick-v<major>.<minor>-rb<N>`, e.g. `trick-v1.3-rb1`;
  versions are never re-published, so the rollback needs its own) with
  `promoted_at = now()`. The manifest follows because "current" is the
  row with the greatest non-null `promoted_at` (BACKEND_DESIGN.md §4).
  No retraining, no re-point endpoint — see MODEL_CONTRACT.md §5 for
  the full procedure.

## 9. Versioning

- **Model version:** `trick-v<major>.<minor>` (judgment call).
  Minor = retrain on new data, same architecture and taxonomy major.
  Major = architecture change, or a taxonomy change that alters the
  output space (canonical renames/removals).
- **Taxonomy coupling:** every model records the `taxonomy_version` it
  trained on (in `models.taxonomy_version` and the manifest). A
  taxonomy change that renames or removes canonical names forces a
  model major bump — otherwise the model's name outputs would disagree
  with the current vocabulary. Additive vocabulary growth (new names
  only) is a minor bump.
- `taxonomy_version` itself is a monotonic int, bumped when canonical
  names are added or changed (master plan §2).

## 10. Open questions

1. Unmapped raw labels (§2.2) — keep-training-with-logging vs
   fail-closed exclusion.
2. Background margin width (§2.5) — ±2 s is a starting guess; tune
   against validation.
3. Fixture regression tolerance (§6.3) — 0.01 absolute is a starting
   point.
4. On-device budget (§4.2) — ≤ 2 M params / < 100 ms needs on-device
   measurement before it can gate anything.
5. Promotion metric for the production architecture (§8) — segment
   composite vs window accuracy.
